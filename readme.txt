the easiest is to install http-server globally using node's package manager:

npm install -g http-server

Then simply run http-server in any of your project directories:

Eg. d:\my_project> http-server

--------------------------------------------------------------------
run python -m SimpleHTTPServer in your project directory, and you can load your page on http://localhost:8000

In Python 3 the SimpleHTTPServer module has been merged into http.server, so the new command is python3 -m http.server.
